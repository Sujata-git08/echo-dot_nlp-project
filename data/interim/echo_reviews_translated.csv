Naeem Cheekkappurath,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using the Echo Dot (5th Gen) for a while now, and I’m genuinely impressed with how much power this small device packs. The sound quality is excellent — clear vocals with surprisingly deep bass for its size. It easily fills my room with music and works great for podcasts or audiobooks too.Alexa is faster and more responsive than before. Whether I’m setting reminders, checking the weather, or controlling my smart lights and plugs, it responds instantly. The microphone sensitivity is also very good — it can hear me even when music is playing.The design is sleek and modern, blending perfectly with my desk setup. I also love the LED display on top that shows the time and volume level. It doubles nicely as a small bedside clock.Overall, the Echo Dot (5th Gen) feels like a solid upgrade over the older versions. Great sound, smart features, and reliable performance — totally worth the price!",BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot Only,13 October 2025,Fantastic Smart Speaker for Everyday Use!,en,"I’ve been using the Echo Dot (5th Gen) for a while now, and I’m genuinely impressed with how much power this small device packs.

Placeholder,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This latest version of Echo Dot may be a better version than previous ones, but I am thorough disappointed with  Alexa Echo Dot. Many times it does not understand the command, many times it simply says Sorry I don't understand, many times while music is on it is unable to catch the voice hence you have to shout to activate the volume sensors for a different command. Majority of the music is picked up only from Amazon, no generic search for the song, you give a song name and artist name, many times it says that it's unable to find the song.I just had a quick glimpse of ChatGPT. The level of AI used is immaculate...it actually mind boggling.I bought ALEXA recently with a perception that ALEXA may have similar level of inbuilt AI, but let's say, ALEXA is far far away from being closest to AI.In first few minutes, I got to know and I declared it as a complete DUMBO.I repent. May be I was overexpecting. ALEXA may have good features for home automation, etc, however if you really want to use it majorly for your music needs, I would suggest you better drop the idea of going for ALEXA.I wonder how a person like Rajiv Makhni gives a complete Thumbs Up for this product and unlike earlier times, provides biased reviews without naming the device drawbacksHope above details help some friends to make the right decision.",BlackConfiguration: Echo Dot Only,15 August 2023,Very Very Average.

Frequent disconnection issues: Every 3–4 months, it disconnects on its own, and I have to reset it to make it work again. This time, it hasn’t connected for the last 10 days.3. Lack of helpful suggestions: Alexa should give regular suggestions through the mobile app or YouTube on how to make better use of it. Right now, we only use it for songs, reminders, time, and weather.4. Maintenance issue: My Echo is kept in the kitchen, and it has tiny holes that easily collect dust.

U can pair it with bluetooth but the process is cumbersome and it does not have a battery and has to powered by cord for use which is not informed in product description. If you are not into voice assistant or dont use it very frequently, it is of no use. Moreover it can't be returned, it can only be replaced with same product, so if you don't like the experience u don't have the option for return. Basically you are stuck with it.

Priyal Kumar,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ultrasonic motion detector is unusable, it works like 10% of the time only. Google it up guys, everyone is complaining about it.Sound recognition is better in English than in Hindi. You can only talk to Alexa in simple sentences. Can't process multiple sentences (Alexa, turn off fan and turn on the bulb) or complex queries. Sound quality is impressive but to play music, you must have Amazon Prime membership or Spotify Premium. It also can't tell you when a place is open or close by looking at Google Maps, only Google Nest speakers have that functionality. Not just its use cases are very less, half of the time, it misinterprets what you are saying, so you have to reframe your command it different ways. For the whole day, if you have to keep on saying ""Alexa, ... Alexa ..."", it feels awkward; Your family will look at you as if you are an idiot.In the Alexa app, I can't save my house address, it shows error?? Also, the app is slow, for each menu you click, it has to fetch data from the cloud.When I tell it, ""Turn on the geyser for 10 minutes"", it instead, turns on my geyser after 10 minutes. When I tell it ""For 10 minutes, turn on my geyser."". That's when it understands my query and does what I want. So, you have to remember what combination works and what doesn't. If you say ""pankha chala do"" instead of ""fan chala do"", then it will say that ""No device named Pankha is found"". So, you have to remember the names of the devices. Like, I have multiple tubelights on smart home n/w. But I've to save their name differently, one is named ""tubelight"", other is named ""bulb"".It rained yesterday, but when I asked Alexa if it rained yesterday, it said ""No ..."". So you can't believe it to know the weather as well.When I ask Alexa about which one of my Amazon Delivery is due today, it instead reads all of my delivery.In plain words, it mostly sucks.Only useful query are these simple sentences: ""Alexa, turn off entryway light"", ""Alexa, turn on the socket"", etc.Google Home Mini is cheaper at Rs.4.5kIts Assistant AI is better.

For the whole day, if you have to keep on saying ""Alexa, ... Alexa ..."", it feels awkward; Your family will look at you as if you are an idiot.In the Alexa app, I can't save my house address, it shows error?? Also, the app is slow, for each menu you click, it has to fetch data from the cloud.When I tell it, ""Turn on the geyser for 10 minutes"", it instead, turns on my geyser after 10 minutes. When I tell it ""For 10 minutes, turn on my geyser."". That's when it understands my query and does what I want. So, you have to remember what combination works and what doesn't. If you say ""pankha chala do"" instead of ""fan chala do"", then it will say that ""No device named Pankha is found"". So, you have to remember the names of the devices. Like, I have multiple tubelights on smart home n/w. But I've to save their name differently, one is named ""tubelight"", other is named ""bulb"".It rained yesterday, but when I asked Alexa if it rained yesterday, it said ""No ..."". So you can't believe it to know the weather as well.When I ask Alexa about which one of my Amazon Delivery is due today, it instead reads all of my delivery.In plain words, it mostly sucks.Only useful query are these simple sentences: ""Alexa, turn off entryway light"", ""Alexa, turn on the socket"", etc.Google Home Mini is cheaper at Rs.4.5kIts Assistant AI is better. And it can tell you when a shop is open or where a particular food item is available in which restaurant. Also, if there is traffic or not."

Yash Kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Alexa Echo Dot speaker is an absolutely useless piece of technology, the listening skills are pathetic, maximum times the device just says I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT, it is unable to create even proper reminder requests, you can't call anyone by saying a voice command like in Google app, I don't even understand why it's called 5th Gen, should be called 3rd class, resetting to connect device to new Wifi connection is a pain, the device has to be reset atleast 3-4 times so that the orange light may show up, the device plays the same news for 24 hours even while stating that it is playing live news, 80% of times it doesn't even understand what a person is saying neither in english nor in hindi; when asking for product supports the Alexa team supervisors are just arrogant and egoistic self-righteous piece of work who don't even listen to your problem and just say use it for 3-4 months and then it'll adapt as if they will return the producy after 4 months if it doesn't work properly. The Google Gemini in the phone, that is absolutely free, works wonders and this 4k costing piece of junk is working like absolute nightmare. The product is direct supply of Amazon and still they don't return it. They sent me a replacement but they are unable to accept that the device doesn't work propely because of the way it is built. A very special thanks to the arrogant supervisor Mr..Soham who didn't even listen to a word I said and kept stating his own set of lines repeatedly like he is CEO of Amazon and Alexa.
