Naeem Cheekkappurath,5.0 out of 5 stars,13 October 2025,Fantastic Smart Speaker for Everyday Use!,BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot Only,"I’ve been using the Echo Dot (5th Gen) for a while now, and I’m genuinely impressed with how much power this small device packs. The sound quality is excellent — clear vocals with surprisingly deep bass for its size. It easily fills my room with music and works great for podcasts or audiobooks too.Alexa is faster and more responsive than before. Whether I’m setting reminders, checking the weather, or controlling my smart lights and plugs, it responds instantly. The microphone sensitivity is also very good — it can hear me even when music is playing.The design is sleek and modern, blending perfectly with my desk setup. I also love the LED display on top that shows the time and volume level. It doubles nicely as a small bedside clock.Overall, the Echo Dot (5th Gen) feels like a solid upgrade over the older versions. Great sound, smart features, and reliable performance — totally worth the price!",i ve been using the echo dot 5th gen for a while now and i m genuinely impressed with how much power this small device packs the sound quality is excellent clear vocals with surprisingly deep bass for its size it easily fills my room with music and works great for podcasts or audiobooks too alexa is faster and more responsive than before whether i m setting reminders checking the weather or controlling my smart lights and plugs it responds instantly the microphone sensitivity is also very good it can hear me even when music is playing the design is sleek and modern blending perfectly with my desk setup i also love the led display on top that shows the time and volume level it doubles nicely as a small bedside clock overall the echo dot 5th gen feels like a solid upgrade over the older versions great sound smart features and reliable performance totally worth the price,"['ve', 'echo', 'dot', '5th', 'gen', 'm', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'power', 'small', 'device', 'packs', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'clear', 'vocals', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'bass', 'size', 'easily', 'fills', 'room', 'music', 'works', 'great', 'podcasts', 'audiobooks', 'alexa', 'faster', 'responsive', 'm', 'setting', 'reminders', 'checking', 'weather', 'controlling', 'smart', 'lights', 'plugs', 'responds', 'instantly', 'microphone', 'sensitivity', 'good', 'hear', 'music', 'playing', 'design', 'sleek', 'modern', 'blending', 'perfectly', 'desk', 'setup', 'love', 'led', 'display', 'shows', 'time', 'volume', 'level', 'doubles', 'nicely', 'small', 'bedside', 'clock', 'overall', 'echo', 'dot', '5th', 'gen', 'feels', 'like', 'solid', 'upgrade', 'older', 'versions', 'great', 'sound', 'smart', 'features', 'reliable', 'performance', 'totally', 'worth', 'price']","['ve', 'echo', 'dot', '5th', 'gen', 'm', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'power', 'small', 'device', 'pack', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'clear', 'vocal', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'bass', 'size', 'easily', 'fill', 'room', 'music', 'work', 'great', 'podcast', 'audiobook', 'alexa', 'fast', 'responsive', 'm', 'set', 'reminder', 'check', 'weather', 'control', 'smart', 'light', 'plug', 'respond', 'instantly', 'microphone', 'sensitivity', 'good', 'hear', 'music', 'play', 'design', 'sleek', 'modern', 'blending', 'perfectly', 'desk', 'setup', 'love', 'lead', 'display', 'show', 'time', 'volume', 'level', 'double', 'nicely', 'small', 'bedside', 'clock', 'overall', 'echo', 'dot', '5th', 'gen', 'feel', 'like', 'solid', 'upgrade', 'old', 'version', 'great', 'sound', 'smart', 'feature', 'reliable', 'performance', 'totally', 'worth', 'price']",ve echo dot 5th gen m genuinely impressed power small device packs sound quality excellent clear vocals surprisingly deep bass size easily fills room music works great podcasts audiobooks alexa faster responsive m setting reminders checking weather controlling smart lights plugs responds instantly microphone sensitivity good hear music playing design sleek modern blending perfectly desk setup love led display shows time volume level doubles nicely small bedside clock overall echo dot 5th gen feels like solid upgrade older versions great sound smart features reliable performance totally worth price,ve echo dot 5th gen m genuinely impressed power small device pack sound quality excellent clear vocal surprisingly deep bass size easily fill room music work great podcast audiobook alexa fast responsive m set reminder check weather control smart light plug respond instantly microphone sensitivity good hear music play design sleek modern blending perfectly desk setup love lead display show time volume level double nicely small bedside clock overall echo dot 5th gen feel like solid upgrade old version great sound smart feature reliable performance totally worth price,88

Underperformance.,BlackConfiguration: Echo Dot Only,"This latest version of Echo Dot may be a better version than previous ones, but I am thorough disappointed with  Alexa Echo Dot.

Majority of the music is picked up only from Amazon, no generic search for the song, you give a song name and artist name, many times it says that it's unable to find the song.I just had a quick glimpse of ChatGPT. The level of AI used is immaculate...it actually mind boggling.I bought ALEXA recently with a perception that ALEXA may have similar level of inbuilt AI, but let's say, ALEXA is far far away from being closest to AI.In first few minutes, I got to know and I declared it as a complete DUMBO.I repent. May be I was overexpecting. ALEXA may have good features for home automation, etc, however if you really want to use it majorly for your music needs, I would suggest you better drop the idea of going for ALEXA.I wonder how a

There are a few ongoing issues that really need attention:1. Poor voice recognition: It doesn’t recognise words properly, especially Indian English. In reality, when we ask for Telugu or Tamil songs, it just doesn’t understand or play the correct ones.2. Frequent disconnection issues: Every 3–4 months, it disconnects on its own, and I have to reset it to make it work again. This time, it hasn’t connected for the last 10 days.3. Lack of helpful suggestions: Alexa should give regular suggestions through the mobile app or YouTube on how to make better use of it. Right now, we only use it for songs, reminders, time, and weather.4. Maintenance issue: My Echo is kept in the kitchen, and it has tiny holes that easily collect dust. I have no idea how to clean them safely.Overall, I feel quite disappointed that I bought this.

Priyal Kumar,2.0 out of 5 stars,20 February 2025,Better buy Google Home Mini,BlueConfiguration: Echo Dot Only,"The ultrasonic motion detector is unusable, it works like 10% of the time only. Google it up guys, everyone is complaining about it.Sound recognition is better in English than in Hindi. You can only talk to Alexa in simple sentences. Can't process multiple sentences (Alexa, turn off fan and turn on the bulb) or complex queries. Sound quality is impressive but to play music, you must have Amazon Prime membership or Spotify Premium. It also can't tell you when a place is open or close by looking at Google Maps, only Google Nest speakers have that functionality. Not just its use cases are very less, half of the time, it misinterprets what you are saying, so you have to reframe your command it different ways. For the whole day, if you have to keep on saying ""Alexa, ... Alexa ..."", it feels awkward; Your family will look at you as if you are an idiot.In the Alexa app, I can't save my house address, it shows error?? Also, the app is slow, for each menu you click, it has to fetch data from the cloud.When I tell it, ""Turn on the geyser for 10 minutes"", it instead, turns on my geyser after 10 minutes. When I tell it ""For 10 minutes, turn on my geyser."". That's when it understands my query and does what I want. So, you have to remember what combination works and what doesn't. If you say ""pankha chala do"" instead of ""fan chala do"", then it will say that ""No device named Pankha is found"". So, you have to remember the names of the devices. Like, I have multiple tubelights on smart home n/w. But I've to save their name differently, one is named ""tubelight"", other is named ""bulb"".It rained yesterday, but when I asked Alexa if it rained yesterday, it said ""No ..."". So you can't believe it to know the weather as well.When I ask Alexa about which one of my Amazon Delivery is due today, it instead reads all of my delivery.In plain words, it mostly sucks.Only useful query are these simple sentences: ""Alexa, turn off entryway light"", ""Alexa, turn on the socket"", etc.Google Home Mini is cheaper at Rs.4.5kIts Assistant AI is better. And it can tell you when a shop is open or where a particular food item is available in which restaurant. Also, if there is traffic or not.",the ultrasonic motion detector is unusable it works like 10 of the time only google it up guys everyone is complaining about it sound recognition is better in
