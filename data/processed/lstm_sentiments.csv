"I’ve been using the Echo Dot (5th Gen) for a while now, and I’m genuinely impressed with how much power this small device packs. The sound quality is excellent — clear vocals with surprisingly deep bass for its size. It easily fills my room with music and works great for podcasts or audiobooks too.Alexa is faster and more responsive than before. Whether I’m setting reminders, checking the weather, or controlling my smart lights and plugs, it responds instantly. The microphone sensitivity is also very good — it can hear me even when music is playing.The design is sleek and modern, blending perfectly with my desk setup. I also love the LED display on top that shows the time and volume level. It doubles nicely as a small bedside clock.Overall, the Echo Dot (5th Gen) feels like a solid upgrade over the older versions. Great sound, smart features, and reliable performance — totally worth the price!",2,2,0.21542224,0.12463777,0.65994006

"It is a fantastic product and is very easy to operate, thanks to the alexa app because it just worked very smoothly and there were no issues or lags with the app. I bought it in white colour and it just looked fantastic.

"This latest version of Echo Dot may be a better version than previous ones, but I am thorough disappointed with  Alexa Echo Dot. Many times it does not understand the command, many times it simply says Sorry I don't understand, many times while music is on it is unable to catch the voice hence you have to shout to activate the volume sensors for a different command. Majority of the music is picked up only from Amazon, no generic search for the song, you give a song name and artist name, many times it says that it's unable to find the song.I just had a quick glimpse of ChatGPT. The level of AI used is immaculate...it actually mind boggling.I bought ALEXA recently with a perception that ALEXA may have similar level of inbuilt AI, but let's say, ALEXA is far far away from being closest to AI.In first few minutes, I got to know and I declared it as a complete DUMBO.I repent. May be I was overexpecting. ALEXA may have good features for home automation, etc, however if you really want to use it majorly for your music needs, I would suggest you better drop the idea of going for ALEXA.I wonder how a person like Rajiv Makhni gives a complete Thumbs Up for this product and unlike earlier times, provides biased reviews without naming the device drawbacksHope above details help some friends to make the right decision.",1,1,0.048940532,0.9439124,0.007147128

"Liked that,Echo Dot 5 can be used as external bluetooth speaker even for 2nd generation Fire TV stick attached to older non smart HDMI TV.It also controlled the 2nd generation Fire TV stick to open applications & all on TV,do some searches on TV as well.It has temperature sensor & some ultrasound sensor which couldn't be tested without more smart devices.The bass sound is good from small speaker. Mics are nice & sensitive enough.It came preconfigured & connected directly from Amazon cloud synced data from 2nd generation Fire TV stick.Didnot like no rechargable battery included.Always a corded wire shows up.Looks bad for a smart device.Didnot like clock & temperature not displayed yet.Did not like Echo Dot 5 showing device not compatible for auto updated 2nd generation Fire tv stick to become home theater system.Even after 2nd generation Fire TV stick was updated from Settings-->Fire TV-->Install updates several times & restarted till it showed latest up to date Fire TV OS.I didnot like vendor lockin for common man. Till date,There is no Interoperability with compatibility between Fire OS,Fire TV Stick 2nd generation,Echo Dot 5,Google Assistant,Google Nest Mini 2,Google Chrome cast & such smart IOT devices which is much required to make more value for money & make life simpler for all.I did not like there is no standardization of manufacturing standard Gaming remote control pairing standards that can work with Fire TV stick.I did not like that Amazon Luna on Fire TV stick is not allowed in India.I didnot like that,no common interoperability open standards for Virtual reality shopping, gaming & other applications with Echo Dot 5 & other company smart IOT devices are being governed by IEEE or such institutions for net neutrality & better future with more value for money without vendor lockin.",2,2,0.16620512,0.13642165,0.6973733

"I’ve been using this device since May 2023, and honestly, from day one, I’ve felt disappointed with my purchase. There are a few ongoing issues that really need attention:1. Poor voice recognition: It doesn’t recognise words properly, especially Indian English. In reality, when we ask for Telugu or Tamil songs, it just doesn’t understand or play the correct ones.2. Frequent disconnection issues: Every 3–4 months, it disconnects on its own, and I have to reset it to make it work again. This time, it hasn’t connected for the last 10 days.3. Lack of helpful suggestions: Alexa should give regular suggestions through the mobile app or YouTube on how to make better use of it. Right now, we only use it for songs, reminders, time, and weather.4. Maintenance issue: My Echo is kept in the kitchen, and it has tiny holes that easily collect dust. I have no idea how to clean them safely.Overall, I feel quite disappointed that I bought this. I should have gone for a Google product instead — at least it understands Indian English and regional language names much better.",0,0,0.93483603,0.039015226,0.02614878

"Giving it 3 because i was searching for a bluetooth speaker and amazon showed as one of the best selling one. It is not a bluetooth speaker in traditional sense. U can pair it with bluetooth but the process is cumbersome and it does not have a battery and has to powered by cord for use which is not informed in product description. If you are not into voice assistant or dont use it very frequently, it is of no use. Moreover it can't be returned, it can only be replaced with same product, so if you don't like the experience u don't have the option for return. Basically you are stuck with it. For me it was waste of money though i admit I should have researched better. Kind of diappointed as it is amazon product and being a customer satisfaction oriented company I expected them to give option of return if one doesn't like the experience.",1,1,0.0037497033,0.9543268,0.041923452

"The ultrasonic motion detector is unusable, it works like 10% of the time only. Google it up guys, everyone is complaining about it.Sound recognition is better in English than in Hindi. You can only talk to Alexa in simple sentences. Can't process multiple sentences (Alexa, turn off fan and turn on the bulb) or complex queries. Sound quality is impressive but to play music, you must have Amazon Prime membership or Spotify Premium. It also can't tell you when a place is open or close by looking at Google Maps, only Google Nest speakers have that functionality. Not just its use cases are very less, half of the time, it misinterprets what you are saying, so you have to reframe your command it different ways. For the whole day, if you have to keep on saying ""Alexa, ... Alexa ..."", it feels awkward; Your family will look at you as if you are an idiot.In the Alexa app, I can't save my house address, it shows error?? Also, the app is slow, for each menu you click, it has to fetch data from the cloud.When I tell it, ""Turn on the geyser for 10 minutes"", it instead, turns on my geyser after 10 minutes. When I tell it ""For 10 minutes, turn on my geyser."". That's when it understands my query and does what I want. So, you have to remember what combination works and what doesn't. If you say ""pankha chala do"" instead of ""fan chala do"", then it will say that ""No device named Pankha is found"". So, you have to remember the names of the devices. Like, I have multiple tubelights on smart home n/w. But I've to save their name differently, one is named ""tubelight"", other is named ""bulb"".It rained yesterday, but when I asked Alexa if it rained yesterday, it said ""No ..."". So you can't believe it to know the weather as well.When I ask Alexa about which one of my Amazon Delivery is due today, it instead reads all of my delivery.In plain words, it mostly sucks.Only useful query are these simple sentences: ""Alexa, turn off entryway light"", ""Alexa, turn on the socket"", etc.Google Home Mini is cheaper at Rs.4.5kIts Assistant AI is better. And it can tell you when a shop is open or where a particular food item is available in which restaurant. Also, if there is traffic or not.",0,0,0.9387254,0.035837416,0.025437232

The Google Gemini in the phone, that is absolutely free, works wonders and this 4k costing piece of junk is working like absolute nightmare.
